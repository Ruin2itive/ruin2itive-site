/**
 * PeerJS Local Fallback Placeholder
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: This is a placeholder file. In production, this file should contain
 * the actual PeerJS library (peerjs.min.js v1.5.2) downloaded from:
 * - https://unpkg.com/peerjs@1.5.2/dist/peerjs.min.js
 * - https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/peerjs@1.5.2/dist/peerjs.min.js
 * 
 * To replace this placeholder with the actual library:
 * 1. Download the PeerJS library using curl or wget (see libs/README.md)
 * 2. Replace this file with the downloaded peerjs.min.js
 * 3. Verify the file size is approximately 80-100 KB
 * 
 * The actual PeerJS library should be obtained before deploying to production.
 * This placeholder is included to demonstrate the fallback mechanism in the
 * repository structure.
